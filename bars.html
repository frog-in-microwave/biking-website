        <h2 class="handlebar_types">Handlebars and Their Types</h2>
        <p class="handlebar_types">The handlebar is a key component of a bicycle that allows the rider to steer, balance, and control the bike. Handlebars come in a variety of shapes and styles, each tailored to different riding preferences and terrains. Common types include flat handlebars, which offer a straightforward design for easy handling and are popular in mountain biking; drop handlebars, which curve downward and provide multiple hand positions, ideal for road cycling and reducing wind resistance; and riser handlebars, which elevate the rider’s position for greater comfort and visibility, often used in city or casual riding. The choice of handlebar significantly impacts the rider’s comfort, control, and performance, making it an important aspect of bike customization and functionality.</p>

        <h2 class="bars">Straight Bars</h2>
        <img src="images/straightbar.jpg" alt="straight bar picture" class="bars">
        <p class="bars">Straight bars, also known as flat handlebars, are a popular choice for cyclists who prioritize stability and control, especially in off-road or urban settings. These handlebars provide a straightforward, horizontal design that keeps the rider’s hands positioned wide, offering excellent maneuverability and balance. This style is commonly found on mountain bikes and commuter bikes, as it allows riders to maintain an upright posture for better visibility and comfort during longer rides. Straight bars also make it easier to add accessories like lights, bells, and phone mounts due to their long, unobstructed surface. Their simple, functional design makes straight bars a versatile and practical choice for many types of cycling.</p>

        <h2 class="bars" >Riser Bars</h2>
        <img src="images/riserhandlebar.jpg" alt="riser bar picture" class="bars" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;">
        <p class="bars">Riser bars are a type of handlebar designed to elevate the rider’s hand position, offering greater comfort and control. With a slight upward and backward sweep, riser bars allow riders to maintain a more upright posture, which is beneficial for visibility and reduces strain on the back and shoulders. This design is particularly popular among mountain bikers and urban cyclists who navigate technical trails or busy streets, as it provides improved handling and stability. Riser bars also offer space for mounting accessories like lights and bells, making them practical for riders who want a balanced, comfortable ride with easy access to additional gear. Their ergonomic shape and versatility make riser bars a preferred choice for various cycling styles.</p>

        <h2 class="bars" style="margin-top: 80px;">Drop Bars</h2>
        <img src="images/dropbars.jpg" alt="drop bar picture" class="bars">
        <p class="bars">Drop bars are a style of handlebar characterized by their distinctive downward curve, commonly used on road bikes to enhance speed and aerodynamics. The unique shape of drop bars allows cyclists to choose from multiple hand positions—on the tops, hoods, or drops—which can help reduce fatigue on long rides and offer a more streamlined, low profile when riding at high speeds. This design promotes an aerodynamic posture by allowing the rider to lean forward, reducing wind resistance. Drop bars are especially favored by road cyclists, commuters, and gravel riders who prioritize efficiency and versatility on paved or mixed surfaces. Their adaptability and focus on performance make drop bars a popular choice for riders aiming to maximize speed, comfort, and control on various terrains.</p>
