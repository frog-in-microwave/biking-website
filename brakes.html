              Bike brakes are essential components for controlling speed and ensuring rider safety, acting as one of the most important parts of any bicycle. They allow cyclists to slow down gradually or come to a complete stop, which is crucial for navigating busy traffic, descending steep hills, and avoiding unexpected obstacles on the road. Reliable brakes improve a rider’s control, making it easier to handle sudden stops and maneuvers. Additionally, well-maintained brakes enhance a cyclist's confidence, helping them ride more comfortably in different environments, from city streets to rugged trails. By reducing the risk of accidents and ensuring greater control over speed, quality brakes ultimately improve both safety and the overall riding experience.

              Today’s bike brakes come in two primary styles: rim brakes and disc brakes, each designed with unique strengths to provide reliable stopping power in different conditions. Rim brakes, one of the earliest braking systems, were originally developed by the Dunlop Tyre Company in the 1890s. They work by applying friction directly to the bike’s rims, creating a powerful stopping force that effectively slows or stops the bike. Lightweight and simple to maintain, rim brakes remain a popular choice for road cycling in dry conditions. Disc brakes, introduced much later by Shimano in 1971, use a similar friction-based approach but with a different design: brake pads press against a metal disc, or rotor, attached to the wheel hub. This system offers stronger, more consistent braking power, especially in wet or muddy conditions, making disc brakes ideal for mountain biking and all-weather cycling. Together, rim and disc brakes offer versatile braking solutions suited to various terrains, riding styles, and weather conditions.

          <h3 class="brake_parts">Rim Brake Parts:</h3>
          <img src="images/rimbreakparts.jpg" alt="rim brake parts picture" class="brake_parts">
          <p class="brake_parts">Rim brakes consist of several key parts that work together to create stopping power. The brake lever, mounted on the handlebars, initiates the braking action when squeezed by the rider. This lever pulls on a cable that connects to the brake calipers, which are mounted near the wheel rims. These calipers hold the brake pads, the crucial components that press against the wheel rims to generate friction and slow the bike down. Springs within the calipers help reset the brake pads after braking, ensuring smooth, controlled stops.</p>

          <h3 class="brake_maintenance">Rim Brake maintenance</h3>
          <p class="brake_maintenance">To keep rim brakes in top shape, check the brake pads regularly and replace them if worn. Clean the rims and pads to remove dirt and oil, and inspect cables for signs of wear. Ensure pads are aligned with the rims, not the tires, and test for firm lever response. These quick steps will help maintain strong, reliable braking.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size: 36px; margin-left: 20px;">Disc Brakes</h2>
          <h3 class="brake_parts">Disc Brake Parts</h3>
          <img src="images/discbrakeparts.jpg" alt="parts of the disc brake" class="brake_parts">
          <p class="brake_parts">Disc brakes consist of several essential parts that work together for powerful stopping. The brake lever, located on the handlebar, activates the braking process by moving hydraulic fluid or pulling a cable. This action directs force to the caliper, which houses pistons that push brake pads against the rotor—a metal disc attached to the wheel hub. The friction created between the pads and rotor slows the wheel, providing controlled stopping power. Disc brakes also include a master cylinder in hydraulic systems, which helps maintain fluid pressure, and rotors of varying sizes, with larger rotors offering more braking force for demanding terrain.</p>

          <h3 class="brake_maintenance">Disc Brake Maintenance</h3>
          <p class="brake_maintenance">To keep disc brakes performing well, start by inspecting the brake pads for wear; replace them if they’re thinning. Clean the rotors regularly with a disc brake cleaner or isopropyl alcohol to remove dirt and oil. Check for any rotor warping, which can cause uneven braking, and replace if necessary. For hydraulic brakes, periodically bleed the brake lines to remove air bubbles and maintain firm lever feel. Keeping these parts clean and in good condition will ensure smooth, reliable braking on every ride.</p>
