        <h2 class="gear_styles">Bike-Gear Styles</h2>
        <p class="gear_styles">Bikes can generally be divided into two types when it comes to gears: fixed-gear (or "fixie") bikes and geared bikes. Fixed-gear bikes have a single gear that directly connects the pedals to the rear wheel, meaning the pedals turn whenever the wheels are in motion, and riders cannot coast. This setup creates a simple, low-maintenance bike with a unique riding experience, often popular in urban environments and among cyclists who enjoy a direct, connected feel with the road. In contrast, geared bikes have multiple gears and a freewheel mechanism, allowing riders to shift to different resistance levels to handle varying terrains like hills or flat roads, and to coast without pedaling. Geared bikes provide flexibility and ease, making them ideal for longer rides, commuting, or off-road cycling, where variable resistance can enhance control and reduce fatigue. Each type offers distinct benefits, with fixed-gear bikes focusing on simplicity and connection, while geared bikes offer versatility and comfort.</p>

        <img src="images/gearedbike.jpg" alt="fixed gear picture" class="gears" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;">
        <p class="gears">Geared bikes are designed with multiple gears that allow riders to adjust their pedaling resistance to suit different terrains and riding conditions. These bikes typically feature a derailleur system that moves the chain across various-sized sprockets on the cassette and crankset, giving cyclists a wide range of speeds and torque. This flexibility makes geared bikes ideal for tackling hills, headwinds, and long distances, as riders can shift to an easier gear for climbing or a harder gear for speed on flat terrain. Geared bikes are popular for commuting, touring, and mountain biking, as they enable riders to maintain a comfortable cadence and reduce fatigue over time. With their versatility and adaptability, geared bikes offer a smooth, controlled riding experience that’s perfect for both beginners and seasoned cyclists exploring diverse routes and challenges.</p>

        <h2 class="gears">Geared Bike Maintenance</h2>
        <img src="images/fullgears.jpg" alt="full gear picture" class="gears" style="width: 700px;">
        <p class="gears">Maintaining and lubricating bike gears is essential for ensuring smooth, efficient, and reliable performance. Properly lubed gears reduce friction and wear, making shifting more precise and preventing unwanted grinding or sticking during rides. Regular lubrication also protects the drivetrain components, like the chain, cassette, and derailleurs, from rust and corrosion, especially in wet or muddy conditions. Without adequate maintenance, gears can accumulate dirt and debris, leading to premature wear, reduced efficiency, and costly repairs. Routine cleaning and lubrication help extend the life of your bike’s components, improve riding comfort, and ensure you can tackle any terrain with ease and confidence. Taking time to care for your bike gears is key to a smoother, safer, and more enjoyable cycling experience.</p>

        <h2 class="gears">Crankset</h2>
        <img src="images/frontgearparts.jpg" alt="Crankset picture" class="gears">
        <p class="gears">The crankset is a vital component of a bicycle's drivetrain, responsible for converting the rider's pedaling motion into rotational energy that propels the bike forward. It consists of several key parts, including the crank arms, which connect the pedals to the bottom bracket and allow for the transfer of power. The chainrings, attached to the crank arms, come in various sizes to provide different gear ratios, enabling riders to adjust their pedaling resistance for different terrains. The bottom bracket houses the spindle that connects the crankset to the bike frame, allowing for smooth rotation. Additionally, the crankset may include protective features like chain guards or bash guards to shield the chainrings from damage. Together, these components work in harmony to ensure efficient power transfer, making the crankset a crucial element for optimal bike performance and rider efficiency.</p>

        <h2 class="gears">Cassette</h2>
        <img src="images/reargearparts.jpg" alt="cassette picture" class="gears" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;">
        <p class="gears">The rear gears, commonly referred to as the cassette or freehub, are integral to a bicycle's gearing system and significantly influence how the bike handles various terrains. Located on the rear wheel, these gears consist of a series of sprockets that enable the rider to shift between different gear ratios, enhancing pedaling efficiency. When a rider shifts gears using the shifters on the handlebars, the derailleur moves the chain across the sprockets to select the appropriate gear. The rear gears allow for adjustments in resistance, making it easier to climb steep hills or achieve higher speeds on flat surfaces. The configuration of the rear gears, including the number of sprockets and their respective sizes, can vary widely among bikes, affecting the overall riding experience.</p>
