          <h2 class="pedal_types">Importance and Types</h2>
          <img src="images/pedaltype.jpg" alt="pedal picture" class="pedal_type">
          <p class="pedal_types">Bike pedals are crucial components that connect the rider's feet to the bicycle, allowing for the transfer of power from the rider to the bike's drivetrain. They come in various types, each designed for specific cycling styles and preferences. The most common types include platform pedals, which provide a flat surface for casual riding and easy shoe compatibility, and clipless pedals, which use a locking mechanism to secure the rider's shoes for improved efficiency and control. Understanding the different types of bike pedals is essential for cyclists to optimize their riding experience and performance.</p>

          <h2 class="pedals">Flats</h2>
          <img src="images/flats.jpg" alt="flats pedal picture" class="pedals">
          <p class="pedals">Flat pedals, also known as platform pedals, are a favored choice among cyclists for their simplicity and ease of use. They feature a broad, flat surface that allows riders to easily place their feet without the need for specific cycling shoes. This design enhances comfort and accessibility, making it ideal for beginners and those who prefer a casual riding experience. Flat pedals often include pins or textured surfaces to provide grip, ensuring that the rider's foot remains stable during pedaling. Their versatility and user-friendly nature make flat pedals an excellent option for a wide range of cycling activities, promoting confidence and ease of use for all types of riders.</p>

          <h2 class="pedals" style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Clipless</h2>
          <img src="images/clipless.jpg" alt="clipless pedal picture" class="pedals">
          <p class="pedals">Clipless pedals are a popular choice among cyclists who prioritize efficiency and control. These pedals use a locking mechanism that secures specially designed cycling shoes to the pedal, creating a direct connection between the rider and the bike. This connection allows for improved power transfer, as the rider can both push down and pull up on the pedals, maximizing each pedal stroke's effectiveness. Clipless pedals are especially favored by road cyclists and mountain bikers for the stability and added control they provide on challenging terrains. While they require some initial practice to get comfortable with the engagement and release process, clipless pedals offer a significant performance boost and are highly valued by those seeking a more connected and efficient cycling experience.</p>
